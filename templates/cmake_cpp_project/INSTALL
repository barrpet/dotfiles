Installation instructions for project
*************************************

Do:

  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make install

The "make install" step may require administrator privileges.

You can adjust the installation destination (the "prefix") by passing the
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=myprefix option to cmake, as is explained in the message
that cmake prints at the end.
